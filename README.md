## Engineering & Coding Guidelines

- **Documentation First:** Update **README**, **design specs**, and **risk analyses** with each change.  
- **Traceability:** Maintain bidirectional links between **requirements → design → tests → verification**.  
- **Testing:** Unit + integration tests; include **protocols and acceptance criteria**.  
- **Automation:** CI pipelines must run **linting**, **static analysis**, **tests**, and **artifact signing**.  
- **Security:** Adhere to **SBOM** generation, dependency scanning, and secret management (no secrets in code).  
- **Compliance:** Align with **ISO 13485** QMS principles and **IEC 62304** (for software in medical devices) where applicable.  
- **Release Management:** Tag versions, publish release notes, archive evidence to DHF/DMR.
